# Hegemony

_Hegemony_ is a free-to-play combo PvP and PvE deck building and dice-rolling game, where the objective is to defeat your enemies through a clever combination of diplomacy, trade, and warfare.

The premise of the game is set in a fictional world, where a crumbling superpower, the United Empire (NPC), suddenly finds itself in competition with its former vassal states (player characters), precipitating an all-out free-for-all war. Years of decadence, corruption and decay has weakened the once-mighty United Empire, and it now finds iself surrounded by competitors sensing an opportunity to plunder its hoarded riches and rise as the new supreme power in the land.

Although the United Empire is in free fall, it is still by far the strongest single power, and it relies on diplomacy and trade to sustain itself. A centuries-long strategy of divide and conquer has all but prevented alliances from being formed among its vassals, at least until now.

## Gameplay

The objective of the game is to fill one's war chest with Victory Points - the player that accrues the most amount of points before the United Empire is defeated (the game end condition), wins. Victory Points are also used to purchase cards, conduct warfare and trade, or gain influence with the United Empire, which in turn helps acrue more Victory Points.

The end game condition is triggered when the United Empire is defeated, which occurs when its own Victory Point count is brought down to zero or less. The starting Victory Point count for the United Empire is determined by the number of players and the difficulty choice the players make (Standard, Experienced, or Competitive). The United Empire can gain Victory Points by Trade, and lose Victory Points via War and Diplomacy.

Every turn, a certain number of cards are pooled onto the table, depending on how many players are playing (3 + number of players). This represents the pool from which the player characters, and the United Empire itself, can purchase cards from and add to their deck. Any remaining cards in the pool after all Player turns are automatically added to the United Empire's deck.

Every player character can populate up to 5 slots with cards that are "in play", meaning that their effects will be active for all interactions between players and the United Empire while they remain in the slots. The remainder of their deck is shuffled, face down and pulled from at the beginning of a player's turn (pulling 5 cards, unless otherwise modified by an active card in play). In order to place a card into play, an existing slot must be relinquished, and any card(s) in that slot will be placed in a discard pile, which will be shuffled back into the player deck once the player deck is depleted. Every turn, players _must_ replace at least 2 of their slots. A slot can usually only be occupied by a single card, unless otherwise stated by card effects.

The United Empire has a variable number of slots in which cards can be "in play", depending on how many players are playing (5 + number of players). As an NPC, the United Empire will replace all of its slots on every turn. This allows for high replayability, low predictability, and variety of stategies and tactics.

Military cards are only known to their owning players and are always played face-down, representing fog of war. They are revealed to other players during battle, and are flipped back down after battle concludes.

**Note**: Even if cards are played face-down, their overall category is known (denoted on the card itself with text and colors).

At the start of a turn, players will take the following actions in the specified order:

1. Draw 5 cards randomely from their player deck
2. Replace at least 2 current slots (can play all 5 cards if possible)
3. Purchase up to 2 cards from the pool and place purchased cards into player discard deck
4. **One** of the following Player Actions:
    * Make war with another player or the United Empire
    * Trade with the United Empire (purchase up to 2 cards from their slots)
    * Replace all occupied slots with fresh cards
5. Following the Player Action, all impacted players may replenish any unoccupied slots with cards from their player deck, drawn at random.

Once every player character has their turn, the United Empire plays a turn.

At the start of the United Empire's turn, it collect all unpurchased cards from the common pool and place into discard deck. Next, it performs the Hegemony Action - an attack or trade action with each player character. To determine the choice between war and trade as an NPC, the target player must roll a die. War and trade thresholds can be influenced by the target player's active card effects, and even non-participant player card effects as well. The base thresholds are 1-10 result in War, while 11-20 result in Trade.

Play is repeated until the United Empire falls, or all player characters are defeated.

### Only One

For increased competitiveness and those with extra time on their hands, players can choose to play the game with the "Only One" win condition.

In addition to defeating the United Empire, the player characters must battle each other until only one player remains. That player is the sole winner and newly crowned hegemon.

## Card types

Cards are divided into 3 categories: Military, Trade, and Diplomacy.

### Military

Military cards are used for both offensive and defensive combat when engaging in warfare with the United Empire or other player characters. Each military card has an attack and defense power value.

When attacking, the attack power totals are summed together and compared against the defense totals of the target opponent - whoever has the larger value gets to claim a certain number of victory points and subtract that total from the other player, which is determined by subtracting the loser's power ranking from the victor's, and applying any affects from cards that are in play among the combat participants.

In the event of a tie, all players involved lose a victory point - war is costly!

**Beware**: Diplomacy Cards can compensate (and even earn additional) Victory Points during losses and can significantly alter the course of a battle, so make sure you select your strategy wisely.

Military cards have special discard rules that depend on whether combat resulted in victory or defeat, and also depend on the individual card's effects.

| Name  | Attack | Defense | Cost (VP) | Effects |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------- | --------- | ------- |
Conscript | 1 | 1 | 0 | After combat defeat, roll a D20. If the player rolls a 17 or higher, the Conscript is turned into a Partisan and stays slotted. A natural 20 turns them into a Professional Solider. Regardless of combat results, the Conscript is removed from its slot and placed into the player discarded deck.
Partisan | 1 | 2 | 0 | Can only be created when conscripts are defeated. After combat victory, roll a D20. If the player rolls an 18 or higher, the Partisan is turned into a Professional Solider and stays slotted. In case of defeat, it is removed from its slot and placed into the player discarded deck.
Archer | 1 | 3 | 2 | Archers stay slotted until they are removed by the player, regardless of combat results (unless otherwise stated by a card effect).
Mercenary | 3 | 1 | 3 | Combat victory costs the losing player 1 VP - defeat costs the loser 2 VP. If the loser cannot afford the cost in case of a defeat, the Mercenary is removed from the slot and placed into the pool discard pile (not the player discard).
Professional solider | 3 | 3 | 5 | Upon defeat in combat, roll a D20. If the player rolls an 11 or higher, the unit stays in its slot - otherwise, it goes into the player discard deck.
Cavalry | 4 | 1 | 5 | After every battle, roll a D20. If the player roles a 14 or higher, the Cavalry can stay slotted. Otherwise, they are removed from the slot and placed back into the players deck.
Scout | 0 | 1 | 5 | Add +2 to all combat rolls. After combat defeat, the Scount is removed from its slot and placed back into the player deck.
Seige tower | 4 | 0 | 8 | Allows an additional solider to occupy this slot. Upon combat victory, an enemy military slot of your choice may be emptied and returned to the loser's player deck. Upon defeat, the Seige Tower is removed from its slot and placed back into the player deck. Subtracts -3 from the Hegemony Action dice roll.
Catapult | 3 | 1 | 8 | When attacking, does double-damage against enemy archers and seige towers. If victorious, enemy archers must roll 11 or higher to stay slotted.
Barracks | 0 | 0 | 10 | Allows 3 additional military cards to be stationed in this single slot. Subtracts -3 from the Hegemony Action dice roll.
Fortification | 0 | 5 | 10 | Allows 3 additional military cards to be stationed in this slot, but reduces its total attack power by -5 (down to a minumum of zero).
General | 5 | 5 | 15 | Increases the attack and defense power for all other military cards by +1 and adds +2 to all combat rolls. Subtracts -5 from the Hegemony Action dice roll. Stays slotted until combat defeat.

### Trade

Trade cards are used to engage in trade with the United Empire and acrue Victory Points. Trade cards can be used for one-time monetary gain, or to help establish long-term trade relations - however, since they occupy a slot that could otherwise be used for warfare or diplomacy, be careful when determining the appropriate strategic balance.

Trade cards stay in their slot until the player or a card effect removes them.

| Name  | Cost (VP) | Effects |
| ----- | --------- | ------- |
Laborer | 0 | Gain +1 Victory Points at the start of your turn.
Cargo ship | 2 | Gain +2 Victory Points at the start of your turn. The player may purchase an additional card from the common pool at the start of your turn.
Middleman | 3 | Anytime a player character gains a Victory Point through trade, you gain +1 Victory Point as well.
Grifter | 3 | Reduces the cost of purchasing cards *from the common pool* by -1 Victory Point.
Scalper | 3 | At the start of your turn, designate a card in the common pool. That card's Victory Point purchasing value is increased by +2. The effect is removed if the card is purchased, or at the start of the player's next turn. The same card cannot be selected twice in a row.
Manager | 4 | When purchasing _any_ cards, place the purchased card on top of the player deck, rather than the player discard.
Insider trading | 5 | Reduces the cost of purchasing cards *from the United Empire* by -1 Victory Point.
Lobbyist | 5 | Select a card type (Military, Trade, or Diplomacy) - that card type now costs -2 Victory Points (down to a minimum of 1 VP) for all purchases
Market | 5 | Get a -1 Victory Point discount on cards purchased from the common pool. You may also sell currently slotted cards for -1 Victory Points of their original purchase value. Adds +2 to the Hegemony Action dice roll.
Factory | 5 | Allows 3 additional laborers to occupy this slot.
Trade route | 5 | Adds +3 to the Hegemony Action dice roll. The player may purchase an additional card from the United Empire when trading with it.
Apprenticeship | 8 | Increase the productivity of each your laborers by +1 Victory Point.


### Diplomacy

Diplomacy cards can enhance (or degrade) in-play military or trade cards, impact the play of other characters, provoke actions for the United Empire to take, punish players for waging war, and otherwise alter or effect the game in impactful ways.

Diplomacy cards are discarded once their effect is used, unless otherwise stated.

| Name  | Cost (VP) | Effects |
| ----- | --------- | ------- |
Diplomat | 1 | Adds +3 to the Hegemony Action dice roll.
Secret Agent | 2 | This card may be played face down. At the start of your turn, you may select an opponent and either look at all of their pool of cards, or look at face-down cards within a single slot.
Sabotage | 3 | This card may be played face down. Anytime a Diplomacy card is being used, play this card to block its effect.
Pity party | 3 | If this player loses combat, they gain 3 victory points. Adds +3 to the Hegemony Action dice roll.
False flag | 3 | This card may be played face down. At the start of your turn, you may select an opponent. The Hegemony Action dice roll will be subtracted by -5 on their turn. Discard one of your own military slots.
Unholy union | 4 | Wedding season is here! Add +5 to the Hegemony Action dice roll to reduce your chance of war.
An offer you can't refuse | 4 | At the start of your turn, you may select another player and swap one of the cards in their pool with one of yours. After making the swap, reshuffle both pools.
Sanctions | 4 | At the start of your turn, you may select another player's slot - that slot will be inactive during their next turn or battle, whichever comes first.
Collateral damage | 5 | This card may be played face down. At the end of the player's next combat, if they are victorious, they may empty a single Trade or Diplomacy slot from the losing player's slots.
Embargo | 5 | At the start of your turn, you may select another player - that player cannot use any of their Trade cards on their next turn. 
Gridlock | 5 | At the start of your turn, you may select another player - that player cannot use any of their Diplomacy cards on their next turn.
Assassin | 8 | This card may be played face down. At the start of your turn, you may select an opponent and one of their currently slotted cards (excluding buildings). It is immediately removed from their slot, and placed back into the common pool.

## Cheating

As a client-side browser game based on the peer-to-peer communication model, cheating is a valid and serious concern.

To prevent cheating, every game event (player action, dice roll) is codified into an actionable "input". This input is processed through an event stream function that eventually produces an "output", which represents the full game state data object. This data object is signed, producing a unique string of characters. Every game event is processed on all client machines, regardless of whether they were the initiators of the event. At the end of the processing, the unique signature of the game state data object is compared across all clients - if all clients have matching signatures, that indicates that the clients are all playing with the same rulesets and game logic (they could all be cheating, but at least they're using the same hax :P).

To further lock down possibilities for cheating, at the start of every player's turn, a list of all possible game events is generated from the current game state - this list is used to verify by all other clients that the incoming game event "input" is a valid input.

These dual verification mechanisms helps prevent cheating and allows players to enjoy a fair game.
